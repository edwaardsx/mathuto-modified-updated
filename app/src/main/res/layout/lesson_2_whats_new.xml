Learn about adding and subtracting word problems as you apply your fractions skills. Let’s see how you solve the problems correctly.\n\nDirections: Solve Problems 1 &amp; 2 below. Be sure to simplify your result, if necessary.\n\nProblem 1: Word Problems Involving Subtraction of Fractions\n\nFrom a 1-meter ribbon, Ericka cut 2/4 meters for her hat and another 1/4 meter for her bag. How long was the remaining piece?\n\nProblem 2: Word Problems Involving Addition of Fractions\n\nJepoy drove his bicycle for 1/3 km going to his friend’s house. Then, he proceeded for another 2/4 km to his cousin. He drove another 1/6 km on his way home. How far did he cover from his friend’s house to his house?"

                android:text="Let's solve the two word problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions.\n\nProblem 1: Word Problems Involving Subtraction of Fractions From a 1-meter ribbon, Ericka cut 2/4 meter for her hat and another 1/4 meter for her bag. How long was the remaining piece?\n\nSolution:\nTo find the length of the remaining piece, we need to subtract the lengths of the hat and the bag from the total length of the ribbon.\n\nStep 1: Find the total length cut for the hat and bag.\n2/4 meter (hat) + 1/4 meter (bag) = 3/4 meter\n\nStep 2: Subtract the total length cut from the original length.\n1 meter - 3/4 meter = 4/4 meter - 3/4 meter = 1/4 meter\n\nTherefore, the length of the remaining piece is 1/4 meter.\n\nProblem 2: Word Problems Involving Addition of Fractions Jepoy drove his bicycle for 1/3 km going to his friend's house. Then, he proceeded for another 2/4 km to his cousin. He drove another 1/6 km on his way home. How far did he cover from his friend's house to his house?\n\nSolution:\nTo find the total distance Jepoy covered from his friend's house to his house, we need to add the distances traveled for each segment of the journey.\n\nStep 1: Add the distances traveled for each segment. 1/3 km (friend's house) + 2/4 km (cousin's house) + 1/6 km (home) = (4/12) km + (6/12) km + (2/12) km = 12/12 km\n\nStep 2: Simplify the fraction, if necessary.\n12/12 km is equivalent to 1 km.\n\nTherefore, Jepoy covered a distance of 1 km from his friend's house to his house.\n\nI hope this helps you understand how to solve word problems involving addition and subtraction of fractions!\n\n"
